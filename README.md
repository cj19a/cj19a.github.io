# üå¶Ô∏èHAVE YOU EVER WONDERED WHY TORNADOES OCCUR IN SPECIFIC AREAS? 
_We have too. That is why our team has decided to commit to the search of finding the number one reason for tornadoes to occur in specific areas. Our research will begin by dissecting topographic features between Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and Tulsa, Oklahoma._

Let's dive right in!

# BACKGROUND: WHY TOPOGRAPHY? WHY OKLAHOMA CITY AND TULSA?
_When looking at areas to compare, we decided to approach regions close in distance to our home base of research: at the University of Oklahoma in Norman, Oklahoma (and because Oklahoma resides in the heart of tornado alley). Because of this, we decided to study two areas of high population within the state: Tulsa and Oklahoma City. As we progessed in narrowing down the factors to further study, we realized that because Oklahoma City and Tulsa are around 100 miles apart from each other, their Meteorological variables won't differ too extreme (temperatures, winds, moisture, etc.)_

_Let's look at some statistics from the National Weather Service Norman and Tulsa offices:_

| Number of EF2+ Tornadoes (since 1950) | Location | 
| :------------------------------------ | :------: | 
|                   41                  |   OKC    |       
|                   31                  |   TULSA  |
