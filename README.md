# üå¶Ô∏èHAVE YOU EVER WONDERED WHY TORNADOES OCCUR IN SPECIFIC AREAS? 
_We have too. That is why our team has decided to commit to the search of finding the number one reason for tornadoes to occur in specific areas. Our research will begin by dissecting topographic features between Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and Tulsa, Oklahoma._

Let's dive right in!

# BACKGROUND: WHY TOPOGRAPHY? WHY OKLAHOMA CITY AND TULSA?
_When looking at areas to compare, we decided to approach regions close in distance to our home base of research: at the University of Oklahoma in Norman, Oklahoma (and because Oklahoma resides in the heart of tornado alley). Because of this, we decided to study two areas of high population within the state: Tulsa and Oklahoma City. As we progessed in narrowing down the factors to further study, we realized that because Oklahoma City and Tulsa are around 100 miles apart from each other, their Meteorological variables won't differ too extreme (temperatures, winds, moisture, etc.)_

_Let's look at some statistics from the National Weather Service Norman and Tulsa offices:_

| Total number of tornadoes (since 1950) | Location | 
| :------------------------------------- | :------: | 
|                   182                  |   OKC    |       
|                   100                  |   TULSA  |      

| Number of EF2+ Tornadoes (since 1950) | Location | 
| :------------------------------------ | :------: | 
|                   41                  |   OKC    |       
|                   31                  |   TULSA  |   

Though these statistics don't vary too much between Oklahoma City and Tulsa, what peaks our interest is the fact that Tulsa hasn't seen an intense (EF3+) tornado since 1993, while Oklahoma City has seen not one, not two, but three EF5 tornadoes in the last 2 decades. We can't help but wonder whether this is a sheer coincidence, or a specific cause.

## TOPOGRAPHY: OKLAHOMA CITY VS TULSA
Let's take a _closer_ look at the differences and similarities between each respective terrain (data given by _topographic-maps.com_)

_Topography map of Oklahoma City. The smoother color gradients indicate less changes in elevation, which is indicative of smoother terrain. The yellow line just southwest of Oklahoma City shows the Canadian river valley._

_Topography map of Tulsa, OK. This shows stronger color gradients, indicaning more frequent changes in elevation. the green line shows the Arkansas river valley, placed just south and west of the Tulsa area._

#### Using this information, we can proceed with the review of various studies that involve the relation (if any) between topography and the development of tornadogenesis.

# RESEARCH: LITERATURE ANALYSIS
After searching through many peer-reviewed journal articles, we can across a few key references that support our hypothesis that topography effects tornadic activity.

### Mary Sue Passe-Smith
Passe-Smith, a lecturer at the University of Central Arkansas, has done numerous studies on tornadogenesis, some with the emphasis on topographical factors.

#### KEY TAKEAWAY: 
Passe-Smith discovered that as a tornado or storm strack crosses a river valley perpendicularly, wind shear is increased, which directly impacts the rotation of a strom cell.

_Left circle shows the river stream path of the canadian river, and the right circle shows the average path of a storm track in central Oklahoma. Once a storm cross the river valley, the is an increase in strength of rotation or intensity of the tornado._

# FUTURE RESEARCH: CALL TO ACTION
Knowing that river valleys play a vital role in the development of wind shear and in turn enhancing tornadogensis is the key driver of our research. 

#### For our capstone research, our group has decided to venture into simulated supercells to setup ideal parameters and terrain in various cases to determine when and how topography supports tornadogensis.
